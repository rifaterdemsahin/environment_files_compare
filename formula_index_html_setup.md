Great! Since it's working, here's how you can **see your HTML app live via GitHub Pages from Codespaces**:

---

### âœ… Step-by-Step Guide:

#### 1. **Place the HTML file in your repository root or `/docs` folder**

If you haven't yet, create a file (e.g. `index.html`) and paste the HTML code inside.

#### 2. **Push the HTML file to GitHub**

From your Codespace terminal:

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add .env file comparison tool"
git push
```

#### 3. **Enable GitHub Pages**

Go to your repo on GitHub:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Pages**
2. Under **"Source"**, choose:

   * **Branch:** `main` (or your default branch)
   * **Folder:** `/ (root)` or `/docs` (depending on where you put `index.html`)
3. Click **Save**

GitHub will give you a live link like:

```
https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/
```

This usually takes **1â€“2 minutes** to go live.

### ðŸ§  Tip:

If you want to preview your HTML in Codespaces *without GitHub Pages*, you can also use the built-in Live Preview:

1. Open `index.html` in Codespaces.
2. Right-click and choose **"Preview" > "Open with Live Preview"** (or click the `Live Preview` button in the editor).

Would you like help converting this into a React app later or bundling more features like `.env` file upload?
